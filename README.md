# React Starter

A basic template that consists of the essential elements that are required to start building a Single Page Application using React, React Router, Redux, Bootstrap 4, Sass, and Webpack.

Although I am calling this project a template of sorts, it is also a mini application in that it demonstrates a full verticle slice of the architecture. What this means, is that there is an example of Redux and React-Router in action. I kept the example simple by providing data via a _'Zip Code JSON file'_.

The template consists of:

* a typical project layout structure
* a Babel setup and configuration
* a Webpack setup and configuration
* an ESLint setup and configuration
* a SCSS setup and configuration
* a sample React component to display list codes
* a Redux setup to handle zip codes state
* a React Router setup to show basic navigation

Additionaly, the template provides a development and production webpack configuration.

The template also allows one to include specific plugins as part of build. [Please see here for more detail](#build-application-with-bundleanalayzer-plugin-included)
